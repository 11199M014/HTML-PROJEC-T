                GROWING TALL ON THE EDGES of Kyoto, the Sagano Bamboo Forest is a once tranquil nature spot that is now a series of tourist-packed pathways, but if you can escape the sounds of camera shutters and boorish visitors, you’ll hear the rustling, creaking, and swaying of one of Japan’s governmentally recognized soundscapes. <br><br>

                The Sagano Bamboo Forest is situated northwest of Kyoto in Japan near the Tenryū-ji Temple in the Arashiyama district. <br><br>
                
                The region experiences unpredictable weather with a rather cool climate and bright sunlight. In this region the summers are short, hot, and mostly cloudy. The winters are very cold, windy, and partly cloudy. It is also wet year-round <br><br>
                
                Only 30 minutes or so from Kyoto city center, the towering bamboo forest is an almost shocking contrast to the urbanity surrounding it. Wooden paths weave through the dense thicket of tall bamboo stalks that reach dozens of feet into the sky, creating a canopy. As the wind passes through the tightly packed plants, the wood bends and creaks, the leaves rustle, and the trunks knock together, creating a peaceful sound like almost nothing else. That is, when the hordes of tourists aren’t drowning it out.
