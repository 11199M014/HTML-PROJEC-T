                Santorini, a holiday destination known around the world for its unparalleled beauty, is a tiny island in the Cyclades region of the Aegean. An island devastated by the volcanic eruption that sank the greatest part of it in the sea, leaving behind the majestic caldera - the only inhabited volcanic caldera in the world. Perched on the jugged rocks, sugar-cubed homes carved in the rock give Santorini its sensational character, one that calls your romantic soul and leaves you awe-struck by the power and beauty of nature. Santorini is an irresistible amalgamation of history and beauty, and exploring it is an experience for all the senses; you’ll find out soon enough why this island is one of the world’s top attractions! <br><br>
                Santorini offers a multitude of attractions for sightseeing that intrigue all visitors and charm them with their singularity and graceful elegance. Starting with a look into the island’s glorious past, the Archaeological Excavation of Akrotiri revealing the remnants of an advanced civilization buried under volcanic ash and lava is a must-see, followed by the ruins of Ancient Thera on top of Mesa Vouno Mountain. The island’s Byzantine and Medieval history is shielded behind the sturdy walls of the evocative “Kastelia”, where the inhabitants took shelter from pirate attacks. The most scenic of the five “Kastelia” are the ones of Emporio and Pyrgos, whereas the Akrotiri, Oia and Skaros ones are also worth exploring. As for museums and exhibitions, look for the Museum of Prehistoric Thera, the Archaeological Museum and Megaro Gyzi at Fira, as well as the Maritime Museum in Oia and the Tomato Industrial Museum at the old canning factory at Vlychada.
